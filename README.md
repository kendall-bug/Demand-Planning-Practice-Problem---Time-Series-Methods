# Demand-Planning-Practice-Problem---Time-Series-Methods
A collection of practicing different time series methods and models in Python.

One of my New Year's goals for 2022 is to become more experienced and knowledgeable in the area of time series analysis. The attached Jupyter Notebook contains my attemps at learning how to clean and prepare a dataset for time series analysis, as well as the process of using and comparing various Python packages to run this type of model. 

The practice dataset comes from Kaggle's Store Item Demand Forecasting Challenge found at https://www.kaggle.com/c/demand-forecasting-kernels-only. The challenge provides 5 years of store-item sales data, and asks participants to predict 3 months of sales for 50 different items at 10 different stores.
